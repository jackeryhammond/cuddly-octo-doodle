PracticeMusicProj

Based on textbook Head First Java by Kathy Sierra & Bert Bates
The purpose of these classes is to help me learn more about GUI's, something I didn't really 
understand at university.

The idea is to create a program that allows me to pick beats and melodies using MIDI classes in the Java API to create a loop of the selected items and play it back to the listener. This will allow me to practice how to make GUIs in Java.

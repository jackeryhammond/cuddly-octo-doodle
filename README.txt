Based on textbook Head First Java by Kathy Sierra & Bert Bates
The purpose of these classes is to help me learn more about GUI's, something I didn't really 
understand at university.

The idea is to create a program that allows me to pick beats and melodies using MIDI classes in the Java API to create a loop of the selected items and play it back to the listener. This will help me grasp how to make GUIs in Java and have a bit of fun along the way.

To anyone reading this, i'm not claiming this as my own work as the text book does give A LOT of help, but I don't care. I'm only trying to learn and improve my coding :)
